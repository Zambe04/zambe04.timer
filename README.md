# Project 
The project is based on the use of JavaScript Basics in order to understant its basic foundations and to test the abilities of the author himself.

## Steps 

The creation of this project was divided into 3 steps:

* `first` - Quick creation of html and css files (without using SASS); 
* `second` - Completion of the JavaScript file, trying to be as clean as possible;
* `third` - Final review and saving.
